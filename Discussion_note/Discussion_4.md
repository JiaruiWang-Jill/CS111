# Discussion 4 (4/27)
## Lab_4
* Use personal hotspot or some home wifi 
* UCLA_WIFI is hard to connect, eduroam needs to modify a special file 
* don't use ucla_web res_web, they cannot connect to the servers
* Start ealry, there are so many bugs. lol. Other's code may crash the server. 
## COMPUTER SCIENCE 
* In industry, the first option when you encounter a problem, you copy the code from google. lol 
* Just want to make sure you learn it, so you can lookup on github etc. just don't copy and paste 
* Don't write __SUPRELONG__ README 
## Tips for Midterm 
* 40 quesitons 
* 3 minutes for each sub-problems. Write quickly! 
* Stick to the lecture and textbooks
* It will ask principle questions, but not simply copy it 
* Harder than peter raye, easier than paul eggert. 
* __write as clear as possible__ 
    * people with clear handwritting will potentially get a higher score. 
    * Don't write supre long answer. use bulet points. b/c graders only spend 1 minute on your answer. 
    * TA/professor prefer not to change the grading. 
        * they will find something more is wrong to argue back. 
        * always the case
* Zhaoxin sample the project grading (grade 1/2 of the projects etc. )
    * always finish grading in 2 hours 
    * each question 10 seconds 
    * __if you can find the questions that will be graded by ZHAOXIN, you could spend less time on it__ 
    * **LMAO 66666666** 
* Sometimes, the professors will divide the questions into 2 parts. If you finish the first part, you can go take the second part. 
* some students cannot finish in time. 
* __20-25 will be taken from the previous quarter__ 
    * UPE review session (you should go) 
    * only this professor (4 midterms) 
## Sample Midterm Questions 
* Use bullet point to reduce the time of writing up answers 
* sometimes, 2/3 correctness will get full points 
* __DO NOT WRITE ANSWER ON THE BACK SIDE__
