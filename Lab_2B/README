QUESTION 2.3.1 - Cycles in the basic list implementation:
Where do you believe most of the cycles are spent in the 1 and 2-thread list tests ?
    They go to list insertion, lookup and delets.
Why do you believe these to be the most expensive parts of the code?
    Becasue there aren't many threads for it to wait for. 
Where do you believe most of the time/cycles are being spent in the high-thread spin-lock tests?
    I think most of the time are being spent on spinning of each thread. 
Where do you believe most of the time/cycles are being spent in the high-thread mutex tests?
    I think for mutex, most of its time are being spent on doing system call including blocking and context swith.
